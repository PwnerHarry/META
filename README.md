# META

Implementation of the paper "META-Learning State-based λ for More Sample-Efficient Policy Evaluation" [1].

The "ringworld" tests use our implemented version of the environment.

This repository also contains our reproduced $\lambda$-greedy algorithm [2], with some additional tools or scripts to draw the figures showed in the paper [1].
