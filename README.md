# MTA

Implementation of the paper "Faster and More Accurate Trace-based Policy Evaluation via Overall Target Error Meta-Optimization" [1].

The "ringworld" tests use our implemented version of the environment.

This repository also contains our reproduced $\lambda$-greedy algorithm [2], with some additional tools or scripts to draw the figures showed in the paper [1].
